Here's a comprehensive list of topics covered in **Lecture** of JS Web Programming with Python and JavaScript:

### Introduction to JavaScript:
- Basics of JavaScript, including syntax, variables, and functions.

### JavaScript Fundamentals:
- **Variable Declaration**: `var`, `let`, `const` and their scopes.
- **Data Types**: Numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays.
- **Functions**: Traditional function declarations, anonymous functions, and ES6 arrow functions.

### DOM Manipulation:
- **Understanding the DOM**: The structure of a web page as a tree of objects.
- **Selecting Elements**:
  - `document.getElementById()`
  - `document.querySelector()`, `document.querySelectorAll()`
- **Manipulating Elements**:
  - Changing text content, HTML content, attributes
  - Adding/removing elements
  - Styling elements directly with JavaScript

### Events:
- **Event Listeners**: Attaching functions to elements for interactivity.
- Common events like `click`, `submit`, `keyup`, `keydown`.
- Preventing default actions, like form submission.

### Asynchronous JavaScript:
- **Promises**: Understanding and using promises for handling asynchronous operations.
- **Fetch API**: 
  - Making HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Handling response data, especially JSON

### APIs with JavaScript:
- **Working with APIs**: 
  - Example with the European Central Bankâ€™s Exchange Rate API for currency conversion.
  - Understanding JSON format and parsing JSON responses.

### Local Storage:
- **Web Storage API**: 
  - Using `localStorage` for client-side data persistence.
  - Setting, getting, removing items from local storage.

### Practical Applications:
- **Currency Converter**: 
  - Fetching data from an external API
  - Converting and displaying currency rates
- **Task Manager**: 
  - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks
  - Using local storage to save tasks

### Debugging and Error Handling:
- Basic debugging techniques in the browser's developer tools.
- Error handling with `try/catch` blocks, especially in asynchronous operations.

### Advanced JavaScript Concepts:
- **Closures** (briefly mentioned in context of function scope).
- **Event Loop** concepts for understanding asynchronous programming.

### Review and Best Practices:
- Importance of separating concerns (HTML for structure, CSS for style, JavaScript for behavior).
- Security considerations, like not trusting user input directly in DOM manipulation.

These topics collectively provide a foundational understanding of how to use JavaScript for web development, focusing on interactivity, user experience, and data management.
